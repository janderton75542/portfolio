# Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: Cyclistic Bike-Share

In this project, I analyzed data using Excel, SQL, and Tableau for a fictional company named Cyclistic. Through my analysis, I developed a visualization of the commonalities and differences of how casual and member riders used different kinds of bikes and created plans of action to assist the marketing team in converting more casual riders into members.
